**Tool:** Instantly.ai ($37/month)
**Volume:** 500-1000 emails/week to start
**Target:** Verified email addresses of decision-makers

**Segment 1: Solo Founders (Crunchbase, LinkedIn)**
```
Subject: Spending 2+ hours/day on email?

Hey [FirstName],

Saw you're building [CompanyName] - congrats on the launch!

Quick question: How much time do you spend on email daily?

Most founders we talk to say 2-3 hours minimum. At $9/month,
our AI handles responses while you build. 500 AI replies included.

Want to try it free for a week? Just reply "interested" and
I'll set you up.

Best,
[Your Name]
Majordomo

P.S. We're $9/month because we're bootstrapped like you.
No VC markup.
```

**Segment 2: Consultants/Freelancers (LinkedIn, Apollo)**
```
Subject: Client emails taking over your life?

[FirstName],

Every consultant I know has the same problem:
Great at the work, drowning in client emails.

What if AI handled 80% of your inbox for $9/month?

Our customers save 10-15 hours/week. That's 2 extra billable
days per month (ROI: 10-50x).

Free trial? Reply "yes" and you're in.

[Your Name]
```

**Segment 3: Sales Teams (LinkedIn Sales Nav)**
```
Subject: Your sales team + instant replies = more deals

Hey [FirstName],

Sales managers tell us the #1 reason they lose deals:
slow response time.

For $9/month per rep, Majordomo ensures every lead gets
instant replies. 24/7. In your team's voice.

Want to test with 2-3 reps? First month's free.

Reply if curious.

## Customer Interview Questions

**For case studies, ask customers:**
1. What was your email situation before Majordomo? (hours/day, pain points)
2. What made you try Majordomo? (what problem were you trying to solve)
3. How has it changed your workflow? (specific examples, time saved)
4. What's the biggest benefit? (time, stress, focus, money)
5. Would you recommend it? If so, to whom?
6. Can we quote you? (get permission for testimonials)
7. Any suggestions for improvement?

**Bonus:** Record Zoom calls (with permission), use for:
- Video testimonials on homepage
- Social media clips
- Case study blog posts

---

## Automation Workflow

**Daily (Auto-scheduled):**
- 3-5 tweets posted via Buffer/scheduled
- 1-2 LinkedIn posts
- Check Reddit for new "email" mentions (set up alerts)

**Weekly:**
- 500 cold emails sent (Mon-Fri, 100/day)
- 2-3 blog posts published
- Email list building: 300-500 new leads

**Monthly:**
- Review metrics: which channels work?
- Double down on winners
- Cut/optimize losers
- Update cold email copy based on responses

---

## Why This Will Work

1. **Price:** $9/month is impulse-buy territory. Competitors charge $30+.
2. **Value:** 500 AI replies = incredible value. Most users won't hit limit.
3. **Urgency:** Email pain is REAL and DAILY. People want solution NOW.
4. **Low barrier:** Free trial = no risk to try.
5. **Targeting:** Focus on people who actually have email overload (founders, consultants).
6. **Volume:** With low CAC strategy, even 20 customers = proof of concept.
7. **Word of mouth:** If product works, $9 price means everyone will tell their friends.

## Notes

- With $100 budget, we CANNOT compete on paid ads. We WIN on:
  - Content (SEO for long-term)
  - Cold outreach (direct to pain point)
  - Community (be helpful, build trust)
  - Word of mouth (best marketing is free)

- The goal is NOT to stay at $100/month forever. The goal is:
  - Get 10-20 customers
  - Prove product-market fit
  - Use their money to scale marketing
  - Reinvest all revenue into growth

- Timeline: 8-12 weeks to first $200 MRR, then scale from there.

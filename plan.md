## Notes

- Focus on PLG (Product-Led Growth) - let product quality drive referrals
- Measure everything, optimize ruthlessly
- Start lean, scale what works

**Questions for Human Approval:**
1. What's the current pricing model and are there different tiers?
2. Do we have any existing customers for case studies/testimonials?
3. What's the monthly budget we can allocate to marketing?
4. Are there any channels/tactics off-limits? (e.g., cold calling, aggressive outreach)
5. Do we have brand guidelines, logos, color schemes ready?
6. Is there a founding story/personal angle we can leverage?

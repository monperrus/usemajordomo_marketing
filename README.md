## ❓ FAQ for You

**Q: Do I really need to do ALL of this?**
A: No. Start with QUICK-START-48H.md. That's the minimum viable marketing. Add more as you have time.

**Q: What if I don't have 4-6 hours per day?**
A: This is designed for 1-2 hours/day after initial setup. Day 1-2 are intensive, then it's maintenance.

**Q: What if I'm not good at writing?**
A: The content is already written. Just customize it to your voice. Or use the templates as-is.

**Q: What if cold email doesn't work?**
A: Then double down on content and social. Or try different segments. Track metrics and adapt.

**Q: What if I can't afford $90/month?**
A: Start with free options only (Medium blog, Twitter, Reddit, manual posting). Add paid tools when you have 3-5 customers.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: Track trial signups. If you're getting 5+ trials/week by week 4, it's working. Optimize from there.

**Q: When should I hire help?**
A: At $500+ MRR, consider hiring a VA for $500/month to scale outreach.

❌ Not tracking metrics → You'll waste time on what doesn't work
❌ Generic content → Specific pain points convert better
❌ No call-to-action → Every post should offer next step
❌ Ignoring feedback → Customers tell you what to build/say

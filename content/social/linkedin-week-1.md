## Monday - Founder Story

**I spent 27 days per year on email. Here's how I got that time back.**

In 2024, I tracked my time religiously.

Email: 3.5 hours per day on average.

That's 17.5 hours per week.
910 hours per year.
**38 full days.**

As a founder, that was unacceptable.

Those were 38 days I could have spent:
→ Building product
→ Talking to customers
→ Growing the business
→ Actually living

I tried everything:
• Inbox Zero (couldn't maintain it)
• Email templates (still manual)
• Hiring a VA ($2K/month, needed constant supervision)
• Gmail Smart Compose (just autocomplete)

Nothing solved the core problem: **volume**.

I didn't need to write emails faster. I needed to write fewer emails.

Then I realized: Why am I, the founder, responding to the 47th scheduling request this week? Why am I writing "Thanks, got it!" for the hundredth time?

90% of my emails were routine. Confirmations, scheduling, common questions, follow-ups.

**Why wasn't AI handling this?**

Not AI that suggests responses. Not AI that drafts for my approval.

AI that actually reads, understands context, and responds. In my voice. While I sleep.

That didn't exist for people like us (bootstrapped, cost-conscious, real problems to solve).

So we built Majordomo.

6 months later:
→ Email time: 45 minutes/day (down from 3.5 hours)
→ AI handles: ~75% of routine responses
→ I focus on: emails that actually need me
→ Cost: $9/month (vs $2,000 for a VA)

I got my 38 days back.

If you're spending hours on email daily, I encourage you to ask: **Is this really the best use of your time?**

Because in 2026, there are better options.

## Tuesday - Problem/Solution

**The $156,000 hidden cost of email nobody talks about.**

Most founders track their CAC, runway, and burn rate religiously.

But there's a massive hidden cost nobody measures: **email opportunity cost**.

Let me break it down:

**Average founder email stats:**
→ 150-200 emails/day
→ 3-4 hours/day managing email
→ 20 hours/week
→ 1,040 hours/year

**Now add value:**

If your effective hourly rate is $150 (billable time, strategic thinking, building):
→ $150/hour × 1,040 hours = **$156,000/year**

Even at $50/hour (very conservative):
→ $50/hour × 1,040 hours = **$52,000/year**

That's the opportunity cost of manual email management.

**"But email is part of the job!"**

Sure. But is ALL of it?

Here's what most founders' email breaks down to:
• 30% - Quick confirmations ("Got it!" "Yes, Tuesday works")
• 25% - Scheduling back-and-forth
• 20% - Routine questions already answered elsewhere
• 15% - Follow-ups on previous emails
• 10% - Actually complex discussions that need you

**90% doesn't need your brain. But it gets your time anyway.**

**The 2026 solution:**

Automation isn't new. What's new is AI good enough to handle nuanced communication.

Modern AI can:
✓ Understand context and tone
✓ Learn your communication style
✓ Handle routine emails autonomously
✓ Flag important items for human review
✓ Cost less than one nice dinner out

**Real example from our customer base:**

Sarah (marketing consultant):
• Before: 4 hours/day on email
• After: 1 hour/day
• Time saved: 15 hours/week
• New capacity: 2 additional clients
• Additional revenue: $6,000/month
• Cost of automation: $9/month
• ROI: 667:1

You track every dollar of ad spend.
You optimize every conversion point.

**Why aren't you tracking email opportunity cost?**

If you spent 3 hours on email yesterday, that wasn't free. That was $150-450 of your time (depending on your rate).

What could you have built with that time instead?

## Wednesday - Customer Story

**"I declared email bankruptcy twice in 2024. Here's what finally fixed it."**

Got permission to share Jennifer's story (founder of a B2B SaaS startup).

**The problem:**

Growing company = growing email volume.

2023: 50 emails/day (manageable)
Early 2024: 100 emails/day (struggling)
Mid 2024: 200+ emails/day (drowning)

By June 2024: **1,847 unread emails.**

She declared email bankruptcy. Deleted everything. Started fresh.

By November 2024: **1,200+ unread again.**

Second bankruptcy.

She told me: *"I felt like a failure. I'm running a successful company but can't manage my own inbox."*

**The breaking point:**

A potential customer had emailed twice about a $24K annual contract. Both emails buried in the avalanche.

They went with a competitor.

Lost deal + lost reputation = wake-up call.

**What she tried (that didn't work):**

❌ Inbox Zero protocols (too rigid, couldn't maintain)
❌ Email templates (still manual, took hours)
❌ VA for email triage ($1,500/month, needed lots of guidance)
❌ "Just work harder" (burned out)

**What actually worked:**

In January 2025, she tried AI automation. Skeptical at first.

Setup took 30 minutes. AI started learning her voice.

**Results after 30 days:**
→ Email time: 4 hours/day → 1 hour/day
→ Unread emails: Started each day at zero
→ Missed opportunities: None
→ Stress level: "I don't have anxiety dreams about my inbox anymore"

**6 months later:**
→ No email bankruptcy since
→ Inbox consistently under 10 unread
→ AI handles 70% of routine responses
→ She focuses on emails that actually need her judgment
→ Cost: $9/month

Her words:

*"I wish I'd done this before my second bankruptcy. I wouldn't have lost that $24K deal. But more importantly, I wouldn't have spent 6 months thinking something was wrong with me.*

*The system was broken, not me. I just needed better tools."*

**The lesson:**

Email bankruptcy isn't a personal failure.

It's a system failure.

If you're headed for bankruptcy (or already declared it), the solution isn't willpower.

It's better systems.

## Thursday - Industry Insight

**Why email automation costs $30/month (and why ours doesn't)**

Transparency post.

I spent yesterday analyzing competitor pricing. Here's what I found:

**Premium AI email tools:**
→ Superhuman: $30/month
→ Shortwave: $30/month
→ Gmail AI (Workspace Business): $20/user/month

**Majordomo: $9/month**

Customers ask us constantly: *"What's the catch?"*

Fair question. Let me break down why most tools cost $30+:

**The typical SaaS cost structure:**

💰 Customer Acquisition Cost: $150-300
💰 Sales team: 15-20% of revenue
💰 Customer success team: 10-15% of revenue
💰 VC returns: Need 3-5x revenue growth YoY
💰 Fancy office: $$$
💰 Conference sponsorships: $$$
💰 Marketing budget: $$$

**To support all this, they need $30-50/month ARPU (average revenue per user).**

It's not greed. It's their business model.

**Our different approach:**

✅ Bootstrapped (no VC pressure)
✅ Remote team (no office costs)
✅ Word-of-mouth growth (low CAC)
✅ Automated onboarding (no sales team)
✅ Small, efficient team
✅ Focus on product, not perks

**Our cost structure:**

→ AI API costs: ~$2-3/user/month (Claude/GPT)
→ Infrastructure: ~$1/user/month
→ Support + operations: ~$2/user/month
→ Total: ~$5-6/user/month

**We charge $9/month.**

Margin: ~$3-4/user (33-44% margin).

That's healthy for a sustainable business. But it's not VC-scale returns.

**That's intentional.**

We built Majordomo for people like us:
→ Bootstrappers who watch every dollar
→ Consultants who need ROI
→ Small teams that can't justify $30/seat
→ Anyone who thinks "$360/year for email" is absurd

**Could we charge $30?**

Sure. And some customers would pay it.

But then we'd be another tool most founders can't afford.

**The philosophy:**

Great tools shouldn't require VC funding to justify.

$9/month × 12 months = $108/year.

If it saves you 2 hours/week (conservative estimate):
→ 104 hours/year saved
→ At $50/hour = $5,200 value
→ ROI: 4,815%

Even at $30/month, ROI is strong. But why charge more when we don't have to?

**The business model works because:**
→ Low costs (efficient operations)
→ High retention (product actually works)
→ Word-of-mouth (happy customers tell others)
→ No massive customer acquisition spending

We'd rather have 1,000 happy customers at $9 than 300 customers at $30 who feel overcharged.

**Sustainable growth > hyper-growth.**

## Friday - Weekend Thought

**It's Friday. You still thinking about Monday's inbox?**

Quick Friday reflection:

Most professionals I talk to have Sunday night email dread.

That feeling when you know Monday's inbox is waiting...

47 unread emails from Friday afternoon.
Another 30-50 over the weekend.
Start Monday already behind.

**Here's the thing:**

Your brain never fully disconnects if email anxiety is lurking.

"Vacation" where you check email isn't vacation.
"Weekend" where you're thinking about replies isn't a weekend.
"Focus time" interrupted by email notifications isn't focus.

**The real cost of email overload isn't the hours spent.**

It's the mental space it occupies 24/7.

The notification anxiety.
The guilt about unread messages.
The FOMO about missing something important.
The constant background stress.

**You can't "hustle harder" your way out of systemic problems.**

Email volume is an external force. Discipline doesn't scale against 100+ daily emails.

You need systems.
You need automation.
You need tools built for 2026 volume, not 2006 volume.

**Imagine:**

→ Friday at 5pm: Close laptop, actually disconnect
→ Saturday morning: No inbox dread
→ Sunday night: No anxiety about Monday
→ Monday 9am: Inbox already handled

That's not fantasy. That's what automation enables.

**This weekend, ask yourself:**

*"How much mental space is email taking up, even when I'm not actively working on it?"*

If the answer is "too much," maybe it's time to change the system.

---

Have a genuinely restful weekend. You've earned it.

And if you can't rest because of email stress, maybe that's a sign to try a different approach.

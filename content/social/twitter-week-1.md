## Monday

### Tweet 1 (8:00 AM) - Pain Point
Spent 2.5 hours on email today.

That's 12.5 hours/week.
650 hours/year.
27 DAYS of your life.

Annually.

And you wonder why you can't get anything done.

### Tweet 2 (12:00 PM) - Value/Pricing
Email automation doesn't have to cost $30/month.

Superhuman: $30
Gmail AI: $20
Majordomo: $9

We charge $9 because we're bootstrapped.
No VC markup.
No Times Square billboards.

Just AI that works.

### Tweet 3 (5:00 PM) - Engagement
Poll: How much time do you spend on email daily?

🔵 <30 minutes (teach me your ways)
🟢 1-2 hours (manageable)
🟡 2-3 hours (drowning)
🔴 3+ hours (send help)

### Tweet 4 (8:00 PM) - Social Proof
Customer saved 12 hours last week.

That's $600+ in billable time.
ROI: 67x.
Cost: $9.

This is why we built Majordomo.

## Tuesday

### Tweet 1 (8:00 AM) - Product Update
Just processed our 10,000th AI email reply! 🎉

Every single one written in the sender's voice.
Zero emails backlogged.
Zero missed opportunities.

This is what 24/7 AI can do.

### Tweet 2 (12:00 PM) - Value/Tip
Email hack:

If a response takes >2 minutes to write, it deserves a call or meeting.

Stop over-explaining via email.
Your inbox will thank you.

### Tweet 3 (3:00 PM) - Founder Story Thread
Why we built Majordomo 🧵

(1/7)

### Tweet 4 (3:01 PM)
In 2024, I was spending 4 hours/day on email.

As a founder, that meant:
- No time to build
- No time to think
- No time to live

Something had to break.

(2/7)

### Tweet 5 (3:02 PM)
I tried everything:
- Inbox Zero (couldn't maintain)
- Templates (still manual)
- VA (expensive, needed supervision)
- Gmail AI (just suggestions, not automation)

Nothing actually solved the problem.

(3/7)

### Tweet 6 (3:03 PM)
The problem wasn't speed.
It was volume.

I didn't need to write emails FASTER.
I needed to write FEWER emails.

AI assistants helped me type quicker.
But I still spent 4 hours typing.

(4/7)

### Tweet 7 (3:04 PM)
What if AI could just... handle it?

Not suggest responses. Not draft for approval.
Actually read, understand, and respond.
In my voice. While I sleep.

Fully autonomous.

That didn't exist. So we built it.

(5/7)

### Tweet 8 (3:05 PM)
Majordomo = your email on autopilot.

- Learns your voice
- Responds 24/7
- Handles routine emails
- Flags important ones for you

You focus on building.
AI handles the inbox.

(6/7)

### Tweet 9 (3:06 PM)
We charge $9/month because:
1. We're bootstrapped (no investors to please)
2. Our costs are low (no fancy office)
3. We want to help bootstrappers like us

Email automation shouldn't cost $30.

## Wednesday

### Tweet 1 (8:00 AM) - Controversial
Hot take:

Inbox Zero is a myth created by productivity gurus to sell courses.

Inbox *managed* is the real goal.

Zero unread ≠ productive.
System that works = productive.

### Tweet 2 (12:00 PM) - Social Proof
"I declared email bankruptcy twice in 2024.

Set up Majordomo in January 2025.

Haven't had inbox anxiety since."

— Jennifer, Founder

This is why we exist.

### Tweet 3 (5:00 PM) - Engagement
Question for founders:

If you could get back 10 hours/week, what would you work on?

Mine: actually building the product instead of responding to emails.

### Tweet 4 (8:00 PM) - Value
Your email AI should:
✅ Actually send responses (not just draft)
✅ Learn your voice over time
✅ Work 24/7 without supervision
✅ Cost less than lunch

If yours doesn't do all four, you're using the wrong tool.

## Thursday

### Tweet 1 (8:00 AM) - Pain Point
You: *finally gets in flow state*

Email notification: "Quick question..."

You: *reads email*
You: *starts replying*
You: *gets pulled into 3 more emails*

You: *flow state gone forever*

Sound familiar?

### Tweet 2 (12:00 PM) - Product Feature
Majordomo learns YOUR voice.

Not "professional email voice."
Not "corporate speak."

Your actual tone, style, and quirks.

Customers tell us they can't tell which emails AI wrote vs them.

That's the goal.

### Tweet 3 (5:00 PM) - Comparison
Superhuman: Makes YOU faster at email.
Gmail AI: Suggests what YOU should write.
Majordomo: Does the email FOR you.

Same problem, different solutions.

Pick based on how much time you actually want to spend on email.

### Tweet 4 (8:00 PM) - Stat
67% of professionals have email-induced anxiety.

The average person has 200+ unread emails.

And yet we're all still trying to "work harder" at managing email.

Maybe the system is broken, not you.

## Friday

### Tweet 1 (8:00 AM) - Weekend Mindset
Your weekend plans:
- Relax
- Recharge
- Time with family

Your inbox: "You have 47 unread emails"

AI doesn't take weekends off.
Maybe your email shouldn't either.

### Tweet 2 (12:00 PM) - Product Detail
"Does Majordomo work with my email?"

Yes.
- Gmail ✅
- Outlook ✅
- Apple Mail ✅
- Any IMAP/SMTP ✅

If you can send email, Majordomo can automate it.

### Tweet 3 (4:00 PM) - Weekly Roundup
This week, Majordomo handled:
- 10,000+ email responses
- Across 200+ customers
- In 30+ different industries
- With 98.5% accuracy

AI email is here. And it works.

### Tweet 4 (7:00 PM) - Weekend Vibe
It's Friday 7pm.

You still thinking about emails you need to send?

Your competitors using AI aren't.

Food for thought 🤔

## Saturday

### Tweet 1 (10:00 AM) - Casual/Relatable
Saturday morning.

Normal person: Coffee & breakfast
Founder: Coffee & catching up on email

There has to be a better way.

(There is. Link in bio.)

### Tweet 2 (2:00 PM) - Customer Story
Customer just told us:

"I was at my kid's soccer game actually WATCHING instead of checking email.

First time in years."

This is why we do what we do. ⚽❤️

### Tweet 3 (7:00 PM) - Reflection
Built Majordomo because I was tired of:
- Email controlling my schedule
- Anxiety before opening inbox
- Apologizing for "late replies"
- Missing important things in the noise

If you're tired too, try it.

## Sunday

### Tweet 1 (10:00 AM) - Prep for Week
Sunday night email dread is real.

That feeling when you know Monday inbox is waiting...

What if Monday inbox handled itself?

### Tweet 2 (3:00 PM) - Founder Advice
Founder advice nobody gives you:

Your time is your product.

Every hour on email is an hour NOT building, shipping, or selling.

New week starts tomorrow.

You can spend it:
A) Drowning in email like last week

What have you got to lose (except inbox anxiety)?

## Reply Templates (for engagement)

When someone comments about their email pain:
"Totally feel this. Used to spend 3-4hrs/day on email. Automation cut it to <1hr. Happy to share what worked if you're interested."

When someone asks about pricing:
"$9/month, unlimited mailboxes, 500 AI replies included. Most users stay under the limit. Basically unlimited for most people."

When someone is skeptical:
"Healthy skepticism! That's why we offer 7-day free trial. Try it with your real inbox, see if it actually saves time. If not, cancel. No risk."

When someone mentions competitors:
"Superhuman is great if you want to work FASTER. We're for people who want to work LESS. Different approaches, both valid."

When someone asks technical questions:
"Works with any email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc). Setup takes about 15 minutes. AI starts learning your voice immediately. Most people comfortable with it by day 3."

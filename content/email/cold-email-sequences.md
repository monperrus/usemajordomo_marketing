## SEQUENCE 1: Solo Founders / Startup CEOs

**Target:** Founders of companies with 1-20 employees, recently funded or bootstrapped
**Source:** Crunchbase, LinkedIn, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers
**Volume:** 500-1000 sends per month

### Email 1 (Day 0) - Initial Outreach

**Subject line variants (A/B test):**
- "Spending 3hrs/day on email?"
- "Quick question, {{firstName}}"
- "Email taking over your schedule?"

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

Saw you're building {{companyName}} – congrats on {{recent_milestone}}!

Quick question: How much time do you spend on email daily?

Most founders we talk to say 2-3 hours minimum. That's 10-15 hours/week you could be spending on product, customers, or growth.

At $9/month, Majordomo handles email responses while you build. AI that works in your voice, 24/7. 500 AI replies included (most founders use 100-150/month).

Want to try it free for a week? Just reply "interested" and I'll set you up.

Best,
[Your name]
Founder, Majordomo

P.S. We're $9/month because we're bootstrapped like you. No VC markup.

### Email 2 (Day 3) - Value-focused Follow-up

**Subject:** Re: Spending 3hrs/day on email?

Hey {{firstName}},

Not sure if you saw my last email (inbox overload, ironically).

Quick context: Majordomo = AI that handles email responses for you.

Not just suggestions. Actual autonomous responses.

Why it works for founders:
• Handles scheduling, confirmations, common questions (70% of your inbox)
• Learns your voice and tone (sounds like you, not a robot)
• Works 24/7 (replies to customers while you sleep)
• $9/month (less than Spotify)

Real example: James (SaaS founder) went from 4hrs/day on email to <1hr.

Used the extra time to ship two major features in a month.

Free 7-day trial if you want to test with your actual inbox.

Interested?

### Email 3 (Day 7) - Social Proof / Case Study

**Subject:** How [Similar Founder] saved 15hrs/week

{{firstName}},

Last one, promise.

Thought you might find this case study relevant:

**Sarah, Marketing Agency Founder**
- Before: 150 emails/day, 3.5 hours managing inbox
- After: AI handles 70%, down to 1 hour/day
- Time saved: 12.5 hours/week
- Used extra time: Took on 2 new clients
- ROI: $6,000 additional monthly revenue

Her quote: *"I was skeptical about AI handling client emails. But I checked every response for the first week—AI got it right 95% of the time. Now I rarely have to correct anything."*

Cost: $9/month.
Setup: 30 minutes.

If you're spending 2+ hours daily on email, this pays for itself in the first hour.

Free trial: [link]

Or if email isn't a pain point for you, totally understand. Feel free to ignore this.

Best,
[Your name]

### Email 4 (Day 12) - "Should I close your file?"

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

{{firstName}},

Going through my list and wanted to check:

Should I close your file, or is email automation still something you're considering?

No pressure either way – I know inbox is overwhelming and "one more thing" isn't helpful.

But if you're spending 2+ hours/day on email, I genuinely believe this could help.

Just reply:
- "Yes" → I'll set up your free trial
- "Later" → I'll follow up in a month
- "Not interested" → I'll remove you from my list

Thanks,
[Your name]

### Email 5 (Day 18) - Final Attempt + Offer

**Subject:** Last email - 50% off first 3 months

{{firstName}},

This is my last email (your inbox will thank me 😄).

One final offer:

If you try Majordomo in the next 48 hours, I'll give you **50% off your first 3 months**.

That's $4.50/month for AI that handles your email 24/7.

Cost of a coffee. Saves you 10+ hours/week.

If you're even a tiny bit curious, try it. 7-day free trial means zero risk.

Link: [trial_link]

Discount code: FOUNDER50 (expires in 48hrs)

And if not, truly no worries. Best of luck with {{companyName}}.

[Your name]

P.S. The offer is real and I honor it – not a marketing tactic. Just want to get this in the hands of founders who need it.

## SEQUENCE 2: Consultants / Freelancers

**Target:** Solo consultants, fractional executives, freelancers with 5+ years experience
**Source:** LinkedIn, Upwork, Contra, personal websites
**Volume:** 500-1000 sends per month

### Email 1 (Day 0) - Initial Outreach

**Subject line variants:**
- "Client emails taking over your life?"
- "{{firstName}}, quick question about your time"
- "15 hours/week back in your schedule"

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Every consultant I know has the same problem:

Great at the work.
Drowning in client emails.

Between project updates, scheduling, questions, and follow-ups – when do you actually do the consulting?

**Quick question: How many billable hours do you lose to email each week?**

Most consultants say 10-15 hours. At $150-200/hour, that's $1,500-3,000 in opportunity cost.

Majordomo is AI that handles client email for you. Not suggestions – actual responses in your voice, 24/7.

**Customer example:**
Michael (fractional CMO) went from 3hrs/day on email to <1hr.
Extra capacity = 1 additional client = $4,000/month.
Cost of automation: $9/month.

Want to try it free? Reply "yes" and I'll send you a trial link.

Best,
[Your name]
Majordomo

### Email 2 (Day 4) - ROI Focus

**Subject:** Re: Client emails taking over your life?

Hey {{firstName}},

Following up on my last email about email automation.

Let me show you the math:

**Your time value:** $150/hour (conservative for consulting)
**Time on email:** 2 hours/day = 10 hours/week
**Opportunity cost:** $1,500/week = **$78,000/year**

**What if AI handled 70% of that?**

Time saved: 7 hours/week
Value recovered: $1,050/week = $54,600/year
Cost of tool: $108/year

**ROI: 50,500%**

And that's just direct billable time. Not counting:
- Faster client responses (happier clients)
- No more evening email catch-up (better work/life balance)
- Mental bandwidth for actual strategy work

Most consultants bill for deliverables, not email management.

Why are you spending 10 hours/week on the unbillable part?

### Email 3 (Day 8) - Use Case Specific

**Subject:** What Majordomo handles for consultants

{{firstName}},

You're probably wondering: "What client emails can AI actually handle?"

Fair question. Here's what our consultant customers automate:

✅ **Project status updates**
Template: "We're on track. Next milestone is X. Will update you by Y."

✅ **Meeting confirmations**
"Thursday at 2pm works. I've sent a calendar invite."

✅ **Follow-up requests**
"Here's the document you requested. Let me know if you need anything else."

✅ **Timeline questions**
"Based on our current sprint, delivery is scheduled for [date]."

✅ **Common questions already answered**
AI references past emails/documents to give consistent answers.

**What you still handle:**
❌ Strategy discussions
❌ Complex problem-solving
❌ New scope/pricing conversations
❌ Sensitive client matters

**The setup:**
You flag which emails types should auto-respond vs. come to you.

Most consultants set it to auto-handle routine stuff, flag anything unusual.

**Result:** You only see emails that actually need your expertise.

### Email 4 (Day 13) - Objection Handler

**Subject:** "What if AI says something wrong?"

{{firstName}},

The #1 concern consultants have: **"What if AI gives a wrong answer to my client?"**

Totally valid. Your reputation is everything.

Here's how we handle it:

**Option 1: Approval Mode**
AI drafts responses, you approve before sending.
Time saved: Still 60-70% (drafting is the hard part)
Risk: Zero (you review everything)

**Option 2: Auto-Send with Rules**
AI auto-responds to certain categories (confirmations, scheduling, etc.)
Flags others for your review (new topics, pricing, complaints)
Time saved: 70-80%
Risk: Very low (you set the rules)

**Option 3: Full Auto with Monitoring**
AI handles everything, you spot-check daily.
Time saved: 80-90%
Risk: Low (AI learns from corrections, improves over time)

Most consultants start with Option 1, move to Option 2 within a week.

**Why?**

Because they check the first 20 AI responses and realize: "This is actually what I would have written."

**Also:**
- AI learns YOUR voice and style (not generic corporate speak)
- You can correct it anytime (it improves from feedback)
- You can exclude specific clients or topics from automation

Your reputation stays intact. You just stop spending 3 hours/day on routine emails.

### Email 5 (Day 19) - Break-up Email

**Subject:** Moving on (last email)

{{firstName}},

Going to be honest: I've sent you 4 emails about email automation.

You haven't replied, which tells me one of three things:

1. **Email isn't actually a problem for you** (awesome, keep doing what you're doing)

2. **You're skeptical about AI handling client communication** (fair – your reputation is on the line)

3. **Interested but haven't had time to evaluate** (ironic, given the product...)

If it's #1: No worries, I'll stop here.

If it's #2: I get it. That's why we offer approval mode – you review everything before it sends. Zero risk.

If it's #3: This is literally a 30-minute setup and could save you 10+ hours/week. When will you have time if not now?

**Last offer:**
- Free 7-day trial (no credit card)
- 30-min setup (I can help over screenshare)
- If it doesn't save you 5+ hours in the first week, I'll personally Venmo you $50

That's how confident I am this works for consultants.

Trial link: [link]

Or reply "not interested" and I'll never bug you again.

Either way, best of luck with your consulting.

## SEQUENCE 3: Sales Professionals

**Target:** Account Executives, Sales Directors, SDRs, BDRs at tech companies
**Source:** LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo, Apollo
**Volume:** 500-1000 sends per month

### Email 1 (Day 0) - Initial Outreach

**Subject line variants:**
- "Losing deals to slow follow-up?"
- "{{firstName}} - quick Q about your response time"
- "What if you could respond in 2 minutes instead of 2 hours?"

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

You know what kills deals?

Not price. Not product. Not even competition.

**Slow response time.**

The sales manager who told us:
- Responded in <5 minutes: 90% conversion to next stage
- Responded in 1 hour: 60% conversion
- Responded in 24 hours: 30% conversion

Every hour you wait = deals evaporating.

But you're already getting 100+ emails/day. Between prospects, customers, internal threads, and follow-ups – when are you supposed to "respond instantly"?

**What if AI handled it?**

Majordomo reads incoming emails and responds immediately:
- Lead inquiries: "Thanks for reaching out! Here's what you need to know..."
- Follow-ups: "Checking in on our conversation from Tuesday..."
- Scheduling: "I have availability Thursday at 2pm or Friday at 10am..."

**In your voice. In 2 minutes instead of 2 hours.**

Real example: Tom (AE at SaaS company) saw 23% increase in qualified meetings after automating initial responses.

Cost: $9/month per rep.

### Email 2 (Day 4) - Speed-to-Lead Focus

**Subject:** Re: Losing deals to slow follow-up?

{{firstName}},

Quick follow-up on my email about AI-powered response speed.

Here's the data that convinced us to build this:

**MIT Study (2024): Speed-to-lead impact**
- <5 min response: 100x more likely to qualify lead
- <1 hour response: 7x more likely
- <24 hours: Baseline
- >24 hours: 50% drop-off

**Your reality:**
- Leads come in: 24/7
- You work: 9am-6pm (maybe)
- Lead emails you: 11pm
- You respond: 9am next day (10 hours later)
- Lead already talking to competitor who responded at 11:03pm

**AI doesn't sleep.**

Real customer example:

**Tom, Account Executive:**
- Before: 50% of leads responded within 2 hours
- After: 95% of leads responded within 5 minutes (AI auto-response)
- Result: 23% more qualified meetings booked

**The AI doesn't close deals for you.**

It just ensures every lead gets an instant, helpful first response:
- "Thanks for your interest! Here's what you're looking for..."
- "Great question. The answer is X. Want to schedule a call?"
- "I'll get back to you with details by EOD, but meanwhile here's..."

Then you take over for the actual sales conversation.

**You close deals. AI handles speed-to-lead.**

### Email 3 (Day 9) - Team/Volume Focus

**Subject:** How many leads is your team missing?

{{firstName}},

Math problem:

**Your sales team:**
- 5 reps
- Each gets 40-50 leads/week
- Total: 200-250 leads/week

**Response time reality:**
- Leads during work hours (9am-6pm): 40%
- Leads outside work hours: 60%

**Outside-hours leads:**
- 120-150 leads/week hit your inbox when you're offline
- Average response time: 12-18 hours (next morning)
- Conversion rate: 30% (vs. 60% for fast responses)

**You're losing 36-45 qualified leads per week.**

Just because of response timing.

**AI solution:**

Instant responses 24/7:
- Lead emails at 10pm → AI responds by 10:02pm
- Lead emails at 6am → AI responds by 6:01am
- Lead emails during your lunch → AI responds immediately

**AI response includes:**
- Answer to their question
- Link to relevant resources
- Offer to schedule call
- Your calendar link

By the time you're back at your desk, lead is warm and expecting your call.

**ROI for a 5-person team:**
- Recover: 40 leads/week = 160 leads/month
- Close rate: Even if only 10% close
- That's 16 extra deals/month
- At $5K average deal size: $80,000/month additional revenue
- Cost: $45/month ($9 × 5 reps)
- **ROI: 177,600%**

### Email 4 (Day 14) - Objection Handler

**Subject:** "What if AI gives wrong info to a lead?"

{{firstName}},

The objection I hear from every sales leader:

**"What if AI tells a lead something incorrect about pricing/features/etc.?"**

Fair concern. You can't risk mis-information.

Here's how it actually works:

**Setup (one-time, 30 minutes):**

1. You provide AI with your standard responses:
   - Pricing tiers
   - Feature descriptions
   - Common objections/answers
   - Qualifying questions
   - Disqualification criteria

2. You set rules for what AI can auto-handle:
   - Initial inquiries: Auto-respond ✅
   - Pricing questions: Auto-respond with public pricing ✅
   - Demo requests: Auto-respond with calendar link ✅
   - Complex product questions: Flag for human ❌
   - Enterprise deals: Flag for human ❌
   - Angry customers: Flag for human ❌

**Result:**

AI handles simple, routine, time-sensitive stuff (70% of volume).
You handle complex sales conversations (30% of volume, 80% of value).

**Plus:**

- AI gives CONSISTENT answers (unlike reps who give different info)
- AI never forgets to mention a feature
- AI can't miss a follow-up
- You can update AI's knowledge anytime

**Customer testimonial:**

*"I was worried AI would screw up pricing. But it's actually more accurate than my junior reps were. And it never forgets to qualify budget."*

— Mike, Sales Director, 12-person team

### Email 5 (Day 20) - Final + Competitor Angle

**Subject:** Your competitors are already doing this

{{firstName}},

Last email, promise.

Here's what I didn't mention earlier:

**Your competitors are probably already using AI for sales follow-up.**

The data:
- 64% of B2B sales teams now use AI for email automation (Gartner, 2025)
- Average improvement in response time: 85%
- Average improvement in lead qualification: 34%

If your competitor responds to a lead in 5 minutes...
And you respond in 5 hours...

**Who do you think gets the meeting?**

This isn't about working harder. It's about not being left behind.

**Special offer for sales teams:**

Try Majordomo free for 14 days (not just 7) with your whole team.

If it doesn't result in at least 2 extra qualified meetings, I'll personally send you a $100 Amazon gift card.

That's how confident I am this will impact your pipeline.

Setup takes 30 minutes per rep. I'll help you do it.

Trial link: [link]

Or if you're already handling volume fine and don't need this, totally cool. Just reply "not interested" and I'll stop here.

Either way, good luck crushing quota this quarter.

P.S. Offer expires Friday. After that, back to standard 7-day trial.
